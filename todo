- Do the read/write_motifs() functions work with the gap slots?
- Allow for scanning with gapped motifs
- Still need to rework compare_motifs() p-values
- Think about writting my own geom_motif()
- Extend current view_motifs() implementation for higher k motifs
- Potential cleaning up needed in convert_type() functionality
- Scan for motif clusters
- Add round_motif() section to vignettes
- General cleaning up/rewritting of vignettes needed
- Check that everything in convert_motifs() still works
- Check that all read/write_*() functions still work
- Add tests
- Visualisation of scan_sequences()/enrich_motifs()
- Work on Rmd output of compare_motifs()
- motif_peaks(): compare two sets of sequences (enrichment analysis)
- motif_peaks(): serious code cleanup needed
- Add scan_sequences() gapped motif example to vignettes
- SequenceSearches.Rmd vignette: in the run_meme() example, fix the
  getPromoterSeq line to use 1000 bases upstream, not downstream
- dependencies to consider removing: ggseqlogo, yaml, processx, Rdpack, rlang?
