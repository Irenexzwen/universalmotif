- Do the read/write_motifs() functions work with the gap slots?
- Allow for scanning with gapped motifs
- Still need to rework compare_motifs() p-values
- Think about writting my own geom_motif()
- Potential cleaning up needed in convert_type() functionality
- Scan for motif clusters
- Add round_motif() section to vignettes
