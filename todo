- Do the read/write_motifs() functions work with the gap slots?
- Allow for scanning with gapped motifs
- Still need to rework compare_motifs() p-values
- Think about writting my own geom_motif()
- Extend current view_motifs() implementation for higher k motifs
- Scan for motif clusters
- Check that everything in convert_motifs() still works
- Check that all read/write_*() functions still work
- Add tests
- Visualisation of scan_sequences()/enrich_motifs()
- Work on Rmd output of compare_motifs()
- motif_peaks(): compare two sets of sequences (enrichment analysis)
- motif_peaks(): serious code cleanup needed
- Add scan_sequences() gapped motif example to vignettes
- dependencies to consider removing: ggseqlogo, yaml, processx, Rdpack?
    + ape: no point as long as I have ggtree (move to suggests?)
    + rlang: no point as long as I have ggplot2 (make my own .data?)
- Add an optional list type which can be used by various universalmotif functions
    + universalmotifList
    + Can do vectorized operations such as subset all names with `[`
- Remove some of the input parameter checking in merge_motifs()/view_motifs()/
  motif_tree(), rely solely on compare_motifs()
- scan_sequences(): allow -Inf weights?
- scan_sequences(): add option to return GRanges object
- create_motif(): add message if detect lower + uppercase in case it's a mistake
- merge_motifs(): add new.name argument
- 32 bit Windows failing examples:
    + compare_motifs()
    + enrich_motifs()
    + scan_sequences() [also in motif_peaks()]
    + motif_pvalue()
