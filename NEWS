CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o New motif_peaks() function: test for significantly overrepresented peaks
      of motif sites in a set of sequences.

    o New get_bkg() function: calculate background frequencies of sequence
      alphabets, including higher order backgrounds. Works for any sequence
      alphabet. Can also create MEME background format files.

    o read_meme() has a new option, readites.meta, which allows for reading
      individual motif site positions and P-values, as well as combined
      sequence P-values.

    o shuffle_sequences(..., method = "markov") works for any set of
      characters instead of just DNA/RNA.

    o create_sequences() has a new option "freqs" which allows for generating
      sequence from higher order backgrounds and any sequence alphabet
      (options "monofreqs", "difreqs" and "trifreqs" are now deprecated).

    o universalmotif objects can now hold onto higher order backgrounds.

    o motif_pvalue() with use.freq > 1 can calculate P-values from
      provided higher-order backgrounds, instead of assuming a uniform
      background.

    o add_multifreq() adds corresponding higher order background probabilities
      to motifs.

    o New get_klets() utility function: generate all possible k-lets for any
      set of characters.

    o New score_match() utility function: score a match for a particular motif.

    o New get_matches() utility function: get all possible motif matches above
      a certain score.

    o The native write_motifs()/read_motifs() universalmotif format is now
      YAML based. Motifs written before v1.2.0 can still be read by
      read_motifs().

MINOR CHANGES

    o Increased input security for character type parameters throughout.

    o Expanded motif_pvalue(), scan_sequences(), motif_tree() examples
      sections.

    o New vignette sections for motif_peaks() and get_bkg() added to
      SequenceSearches.Rmd.

    o Various vignette tweaks.

    o Fixed various spelling mistakes throughout, added Language field to
      Description, and added spell check to tests.

    o Documentation for the "random" shuffling method has been removed and a
      warning is shown when used to tell the user that it will be removed in
      the next minor update.

    o Generally increased test coverage.

    o The "linear" and "markov" shuffling methods are much faster.

    o create_sequences() for higher order backgrounds is much faster.

    o Faster add_multifreqs(): slight improvement for DNA motifs, big
      improvement for non-DNA motifs.

    o sample_sites() has been rewritten for use.freq > 1: the probability of
      each letter in the site is now dependent on the previous letters (also
      faster and more memory efficient for any use.freq).

    o Big improvement to calculating motif scores from p-value input: no
      longer guesses different scores, instead estimating a normal distribution
      of scores. This new approach is much, much faster and more memory
      efficient. It does however assume a uniform background.

    o The "score.pct" column in scan_sequences() results now represents the
      percent score based on the total possible score, not just the score
      between zero and the max possible score.

    o summarise_motifs() is much faster.

    o Objects in data/ are saved using serialization format version 3.

    o convert_motifs(motif, class = "universalmotif-universalmotif"): performs
      a validObject() check if "motif" is a universalmotif object.

    o The show() method for universalmotif objects performs a validObject()
      check first.

    o motif_rc() has a new option "ignore.alphabet", used to turn on or off the
      alphabet check (checks for DNA/RNA motif).

    o Added "overwrite" and "append" options to write_*() functions.

    o New motif_score() utility function: calculate motif score from input
      thresholds.

    o enrich_motifs(..., return.scan.results = FALSE): uses a slimmed down
      version of scan_sequences() which skips construction of the complete
      results data.frame, saving a tiny bit of time on large jobs.

    o compare_motifs() now includes log P-values. This way comparisons can
      still be properly ranked even if their P-values are below the machine
      limit.

    o convert_motifs() from MotifList (MotifDb) carries over dataSource.

    o If a MEME motif has two names, the second will be assigned as "altname"
      by read_meme().

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed IC score calculation from character input in create_motif().

    o The internal DNA consensus letter calculation previously did not assign
      ambiguous letters when one PPM position was >0.5 and another was >0.25.
      This was unintended behaviour and will now output the proper ambigous
      DNA letter.
